### Section 7.01 Indemnity Under Law.&#x20;

The Corporation shall indemnify and advance the expenses of each person to the full extent permitted by law.

### Section 7.02 Additional Indemnification.

The Corporation hereby agrees to hold harmless and indemnify each of its Directors, Officers, employees and agents (the “Indemnitee”) from and against, and to reimburse the Indemnitee for, any and all judgments, fines, liabilities, amounts paid in settlement and reasonable expenses, including attorneys’ fees actually and necessarily incurred, as a result of or in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, other than one by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor, including an action, suit or proceeding by or in the right of any other corporation of any type or kind, domestic or foreign, or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise for which the Indemnitee served in any capacity at the request of the Corporation, to which the Indemnitee is, was or at any time becomes a party, or is threatened to be made a party, or as a result of or in connection with any appeal therein, by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee is, was or at any time becomes a Director or Officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving or at any time serves such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise in any capacity, whether arising out of any breach of the Indemnitee’s fiduciary duty as a Director, Officer, employee or agent of such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise under any state or federal law or otherwise; provided, however, that no indemnity pursuant to this Section 2 shall be paid by the Corporation (i) if a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to the Indemnitee establishes that the Indemnitee’s acts were committed in bad faith or were the result of active and deliberate dishonesty and were material to the cause of action so adjudicated, or that the Indemnitee personally gained in fact a financial profit or other advantage to which the Indemnitee was not legally entitled; or (ii) if a final judgment by a court having jurisdiction in the matter shall determine that such indemnification is not lawful. The termination of any such civil or criminal action or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create any presumption that the Indemnitee acted in bad faith and/or was dishonest.&#x20;

a. The obligation of the Corporation to indemnify contained herein shall continue during the period the Indemnitee serves as a Director, Officer, employee or agent of the Corporation and shall continue thereafter so long as the Indemnitee shall be subject to any possible claim or threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee was a Director or Officer of the Corporation or served at the request of the Corporation in any capacity for any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise.&#x20;

b. Promptly after receipt by the Indemnitee of notice of the commencement of any action, suit or proceeding, the Indemnitee will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the Corporation under this Section 2, notify the Corporation of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the Corporation will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to the Indemnitee otherwise than under this Section 2. With respect to any such action, suit or proceeding as to which the Indemnitee notifies the Corporation of the commencement thereof:&#x20;

1. The Corporation will be entitled to participate therein at its own expense; and,&#x20;
2. Except as otherwise provided in the last sentence of this subpart ii, to the extent that it may wish, the Corporation jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified will be entitled to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to the Indemnitee. After notice from the Corporation to the Indemnitee of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the Corporation will not be liable to the Indemnitee under this Section 2 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation or as otherwise provided in the last sentence of this subpart ii. The Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his or her own counsel in such action, suit or proceeding but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the Corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of the Indemnitee unless (A) the employment of counsel by the Indemnitee has been authorized by the Corporation in connection with the defense of such action, (B) the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the Corporation and the Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such action, or (C) the Corporation shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel for the Indemnitee shall be borne by the Corporation (it being understood, however, that the Corporation shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one counsel for the Indemnitee in connection with any action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances). The Corporation shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any action, suit or proceeding brought by or on behalf of the Corporation or as to which the Indemnitee shall have made the conclusion provided for in clause (B) of the preceding sentence of this subpart ii.&#x20;
3. Anything in this Section 2 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Corporation shall not be liable to indemnify the Indemnitee under this Section 2 for any amounts paid in settlement of any action or claim effected without its written consent. The Corporation shall not settle any action or claim in any manner which would impose any penalty or limitation on the Indemnitee without the Indemnitee’s written consent. Neither the Corporation nor any such person will unreasonably withhold their consent to any proposed settlement.&#x20;

c. In the event of any threatened or pending action, suit or proceeding which may give rise to a right of indemnification from the Corporation to the Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 2, the Corporation shall pay, on demand, in advance of the final disposition thereof, expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in defending such action, suit or proceeding, other than those expenses for which the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification pursuant to clause (ii) of the proviso to part (a) of this Section 2 or part (b) of this Section 2. The Corporation shall make such payments upon receipt of a written request made by the Indemnitee for payment of such expenses, (ii) an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation hereunder, and (iii) evidence satisfactory to the Corporation as to the amount of such expenses. The Indemnitee’s written certification together with a copy of the statement paid or to be paid by the Indemnitee shall constitute satisfactory evidence as to the amount of such expenses.&#x20;

d. The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses granted to the Indemnitee under this Section 2 shall not be deemed exclusive, or in limitation of any other rights to which the Indemnitee may now or hereafter be entitled under the Corporation’s Certificate of Incorporation or otherwise under the Corporation’s By-Laws, as now in effect or as hereafter amended, any agreement, any vote of members or Directors, any applicable law, or otherwise.&#x20;

### Section 7.03 Limitation.&#x20;

No amendment, modification or rescission of this Article VII shall be effective to limit any person’s right to indemnification with respect to any alleged cause of action that accrues or other incident or matter that occurs prior to the date on which such modification, amendment or rescission is adopted.

## Article 8. Dissolution

The Corporation may be dissolved only upon adoption of a plan of dissolution and distribution of assets by the Board that is consistent with the Certificate of Incorporation and with State law.

## Article 9. Amendments

### Section 9.01: Approval of Amendments.&#x20;
